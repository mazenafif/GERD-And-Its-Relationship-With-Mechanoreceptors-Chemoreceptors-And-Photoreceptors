The preliminary draw molecules of odor after passing out decomposition and then be transferred to the Lipids by the production of a molecule complement from Adipose tissue to re- build Lipids ( Exchange of material ). This makes the patient for a long time does not want to eat.&nbsp;Especially smells of mercury-containing molecules are the most influence on the physiological appetite as it is when a person is approaching the odors emitted from the combustion reactions oily plants or chew plants leaves contain a high proportion of iron and has a silvery thin membrane<br></div>

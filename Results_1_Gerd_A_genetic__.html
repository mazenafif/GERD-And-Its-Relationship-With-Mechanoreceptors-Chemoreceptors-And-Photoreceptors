<div>Results:<br></div><div>1- GERD A genetic diseases , a binary pattern ( the processes of exponential growth of genetic molecules competent cell reception mechanism during the transition from parents to children ) , and are its effects in reaction facilities for the development of the senses of a person , especially the pattern of secondary phase that physiological changes occur in the appetite of the person remains for a long time without feeling deliciously food. The preliminary draw molecules of odor after passing out decomposition and then be transferred to the Lipids by the production of a molecule complement from Adipose tissue to re- build Lipids ( Exchange of material ). This makes the patient for a long time does not want to eat.&nbsp;Especially smells of mercury-containing molecules are the most influence on the physiological appetite as it is when a person is approaching the odors emitted from the combustion reactions oily plants or chew plants leaves contain a high proportion of iron and has a silvery thin membrane.&nbsp;Therefore, appetite mechanism resulting from the rate of secretion of the hormone leptin and Ghrelin subject to synchronize internal determinants ( odor molecules ) with time function to absorb the energy compensation and break dormancy phase or to launch energy and enter into dormancy phase as well as mutations arise carcinogens.<br></div><div>2-&nbsp;The smell of beeswax serve to open up the appetite and the creation of a dynamic equilibrium is also the position of the body , particularly the nerves in the back of the head , and the thyroid gland during sleep.<br></div><div>3- Most patients with GERD show ( who live in the same village ) that the physiology of appetite associated with neurological behavior changes are subject to the automatic rhythm synchronous cycle time ( stimuli wavelengths ) from sunrise until sunset , especially when exposed to odors or chewing the leaves of the trees , but they feel a desire appetite during the Night between 9-2 after midnight , and then back again the symptoms of GERD .&nbsp;Nervous regulation is affected by influences modified and lead to a hormonal response reaction. The most important of these effects are electrochemical energy resulting from audio receptor, which contain a high thermal energy (heat and entropy of time), also other part is stored in the target cells (complementarity molecules ) and controls the receptor molecular cognition which lead to Biogravetropism (Cells electrochemical affinity transpiration towards developed external cosplay as a result of cellular response due to the influence of hormones) and this is called the evolution of the human senses by the accumulation molecular updated mated molecular through its interactions with the environment, such as food, drink and thought and friends. Stages of Change mechanism: hormones are produced spectral (frequency, entropy, heat, speed) contained particles of energy between the crystalline structures (as the status of synapses) and serves as the isotopes of neurotransmitters, which in turn is affected look asthe harmonious rhythm according to the phases of the synchronization.&nbsp;To illustrate the self- synthesis mechanism collects molecules complementary and who gets to patients with GERD , the ability of receptors to draw food in its simplest form , and in theory, have their own food to keep them this food extract for a longer time without feeling hungry . This is completely waterproof iced happening inside a container placed in hot surroundings where droplets form on the surface of the pot and the fact that the result of the exchange of the hydrogen ion &nbsp;[H +] , which has a property permeability is then bonding with hydroxyl [OH-] in the air to reconfigure polymers water.<br></div>

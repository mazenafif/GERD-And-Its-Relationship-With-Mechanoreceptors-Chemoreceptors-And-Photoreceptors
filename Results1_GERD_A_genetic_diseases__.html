<div><b>Results</b><br></div><div>1- GERD A genetic diseases , a binary pattern ( the processes of exponential growth of genetic molecules competent cell reception mechanism during the transition from parents to children ) , and are its effects in reaction facilities for the development of the senses of a person , especially the pattern of secondary phase that physiological changes occur in the appetite of the person remains for a long time without feeling deliciously food. The preliminary draw molecules of odor after passing out decomposition and then be transferred to the Lipids by the production of a molecule complement from Adipose tissue to re- build Lipids ( Exchange of material ). This makes the patient for a long time does not want to eat.&nbsp;Especially smells of mercury-containing molecules are the most influence on the physiological appetite as it is when a person is approaching the odors emitted from the combustion reactions oily plants or chew plants leaves contain a high proportion of iron and has a silvery thin membrane.&nbsp;Therefore, appetite mechanism resulting from the rate of secretion of the hormone leptin and Ghrelin subject to synchronize internal determinants ( odor molecules ) with time function to absorb the energy compensation and break dormancy phase or to launch energy and enter into dormancy phase as well as mutations arise carcinogens.<br></div><div>2-&nbsp;The smell of beeswax serve to open up the appetite and the creation of a dynamic equilibrium is also the position of the body , particularly the nerves in the back of the head , and the thyroid gland during sleep.<br></div><div>3- Most patients with GERD show ( who live in the same village ) that the physiology of appetite associated with neurological behavior changes are subject to the automatic rhythm synchronous cycle time ( stimuli wavelengths ) from sunrise until sunset , especially when exposed to odors or chewing the leaves of the trees , but they feel a desire appetite during the Night between 9-2 after midnight , and then back again the symptoms of GERD .&nbsp;Nervous regulation is affected by influences modified and lead to a hormonal response reaction. The most important of these effects are electrochemical energy resulting from audio receptor, which contain a high thermal energy (heat and entropy of time), also other part is stored in the target cells (complementarity molecules ) and controls the receptor molecular cognition which lead to Biogravetropism (Cells electrochemical affinity transpiration towards developed external cosplay as a result of cellular response due to the influence of hormones) and this is called the evolution of the human senses by the accumulation molecular updated mated molecular through its interactions with the environment, such as food, drink and thought and friends. Stages of Change mechanism: hormones are produced spectral (frequency, entropy, heat, speed) contained particles of energy between the crystalline structures (as the status of synapses) and serves as the isotopes of neurotransmitters, which in turn is affected look asthe harmonious rhythm according to the phases of the synchronization.&nbsp;To illustrate the self- synthesis mechanism collects molecules complementary and who gets to patients with GERD , the ability of receptors to draw food in its simplest form , and in theory, have their own food to keep them this food extract for a longer time without feeling hungry . This is completely waterproof iced happening inside a container placed in hot surroundings where droplets form on the surface of the pot and the fact that the result of the exchange of the hydrogen ion &nbsp;[H +] , which has a property permeability is then bonding with hydroxyl [OH-] in the air to reconfigure polymers water.<br></div><div>5-&nbsp;When chewing khat active oral microbes and then interact with the plant extract and leads to stimulate the glands secretion in the stomach and pancreas , especially papers that contain iron and mercury and chlorides at high rates . This is because the metabolism of these cells do not have during the day, but to be a period of metabolism at night and on , there is a visual mechanism resembling functionally photosynthesis during the day keeps those cells in the case of passivation . As for the night are the cells needed for chlorides liberated from sodium chloride, particularly in patients with GERD since 9-2 after midnight, where the taste cells are in the tongue in the active state and which is an alert sense centers in the brain and this means that patients with GERD to stay awake for a long period even fall stimuli appetite for uniformity and to compensate the body including the needs, particularly the amount of salt and so there is an exchange functional or in other words coincided phases and functional, for example, the firing of the nose during the day and its effect on appetite by extracting mitochondrial energy for the production of fat, as well as the tongue of the night and its effect on the endocrine secretion stimulants in the brain through the chlorides active (chlorine anions). The best way to eat at night to be with water just to keep the rhythm of appetite and alerts the brain, as is the day where nose microbes aromatherapy affected.This means for sensing proteins sensory ability emulsification - complete , where the extraction of energy from the odor molecules and combined with the complements of synthetic polymers to form energy. The night is perfect period , phase synchronization of photoreceptors with internal determinants of cells ( the rotation of the firing of the sympathetic and para- sympathetic nervous system to due equilibrium ) , and is represented in the analysis and synthesis of the important elements of biological processes which are difficult to produce during the period of sunlight. Synthetic polymers are produced after the production of lithium ions [+Li] at night , especially during a meal with mineral water. Thus, that feeling of happiness. Vigilance also play a role in the synchronized rhythm of the nervous regulation and hormonal regulation to ensure the process of synergies.<br></div><div>6-&nbsp;Sound Energy ( Fractional waves), transformed into energy electrochemical able to switch to the replicator effective molecule . This explains why some people exposed to behavioral changes as a result of some negative thoughts that originates from sound waves and low-frequency , which also play a role in modifying the genes involuntary , having accepted voluntarily by the person . And the wavelengths of the sound of low frequencies affected by several factors, including : neural plasticity , temperature, density and built carrier ; because the synthesis processes rely on speed to coincide chronologically. Function and complement differential .These reasons are behind Alzheimer's , schizophrenia , cancer, and depression due to the emergence of the neural plasticity is a perfect environment for replication. Even in the way of manipulating the data affected by several characteristics : density, temperature, plasticity . This means that the impact strength of the waves fractals depends on the properties of matter in which the move .<br></div><div>Commensurate with the power of influence is directly proportional to the square root of the temperature.<br></div><div>And inversely proportional to the density when there is evidence of neurological plasticity.<br></div><div>7-&nbsp;Ghrelin has fractals structure, therefore it is a multi- functional roles , depending on the crystalline edges coincided with the stimuli or molecules involved in the reaction.  Where to take the role of complementary molecule or stimulating hormone. Whenever a long sleep period - in early at night - the body consumes a lot of energy , and thus the lack of body weight ; and whenever remained a person awake for a longer period (up to midnight with eating a little food ) , the less energy consumption and therefore stored as fat in the muscles and cause increased body weight.As well as play a role in feeding the nervous system. Leptin is controlled automated during sunlight, due to the optical influenced lengths making the body consumes less energy and therefore inhibits appetite. And those of synthetic processes rely on the edge effect of both receptors such as “GPCR”.<br></div><div><b>Conclusions:&nbsp;</b>Evolution does not mean the transformation of the human form but means only the evolution of sensory receptors ; because the structure of the human body is an integrated structure in the universe. The evolution of sensory receptors in the auditory receptor 's ability to receive low- frequency waves , and also the role of Olfactory and taste receptors in the emulsification of energy types from odor molecules After exposure to microbes , especially air yeast, and then to produce fat.And the production of energy, such as fat by molecular complementarity , which depends on the type of RNA material emitted or which carries sound waves. This means that each nucleic acid consists mainly of the lengths of sound waves and bilateral energy time.&nbsp;Genes have a pentagonal structure , to synchronize their edges with external influences , to modify the reformer ; must practice behavioral education for a certain period , and that means re- synthesis processes reminder.<br></div>

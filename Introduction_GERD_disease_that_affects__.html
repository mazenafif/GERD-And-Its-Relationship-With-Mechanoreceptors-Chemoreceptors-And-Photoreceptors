<div>Introduction <br></div><div>GERD disease that affects many people here may appear in some individuals as a genetic disease where the spread between family members, and rarely eating appetite.&nbsp;Proposed respiratory contributions to the development of GERD include respiratory medications that may alter esophageal sphincter tone and changes in respiratory mechanics, with increased lung hyperinflation compromising the antireflux barrier [1]. Although GERD is usually confined to the lower esophagus in some individuals, it may be associated with pulmonary microaspiration of gastric contents [2].&nbsp;And we will explain what are the scents that aggravate GERD disease and the mechanism of this happening between the olfactory receptors and the vagus nerve .&nbsp;GERD is causing a lot of trouble to the people and lead to weight loss and feeling angry for long time. &nbsp;A person sensitive to odors and so we will explain how this relationship smells norepinephrine hormones for digestion. Some studies have shown a relationship leptin The identification of genes induced by leptin in the relevant cell types and the determination of the role they play in body weight regulation will address many still unanswered questions concerning body weight homeostasis, [3]. Through the preview it shows that GERD patients are sensitive to odors and that some of them lead to decreased appetite This means a feeling of fullness . Since a lot of research studies conducted on animals , but I this actual preview on patients with GERD and observe physiological changes in them and that means experience the best proof . This research relies on observation and conclusion.<br></div><div>Why dampen the interest of appetite in patients who suffer&nbsp; GERD, when they are exposed to certain smells?<br></div><div>We'll explain how to affected sensors sensual aromatherapy.<br></div><div>Why do not feel hungry who suffer GERD disease ?<br></div><div>What will you do if you get GERD?<br></div><div>GERD patient 's disease does not want food . Why? And how to explain it when a person stays for a long time , which did not feel the desire for food ? Is there a self- sufficient production within the cells of their needs ? Thus, means that certain scents play a role in the proportion Ghrelin, therefore the person does not feel hungry. Sometimes the patient feels that a meal is palatable , quickly feel satiety , especially that they contain fatty certain odors.The ob gene product, leptin, is an important circulating signal for the regulation of body weight [ Tartaglia, Louis A., et al. 1995] [4]. One pathway leads through cells of the Bowmanâ€™s glands into the duct of the gland, with fibroblasts of the lamina propria being a potential intermediary . Amino acid odors are detected by olfactory sensory neurons that express only one out of many olfactory receptor genes. Axons of sensory neurons containing the same olfactory receptor converge on specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb [5,6,7]. Therefore, leptin plays a role in regulating energy consumption and from the smells that cling Bowman glands in the nose is extracted primary particles are then assembled with mental fabric crystals to produce enough fatty principals body's need for this patient stays for long without feeling hungry. <br></div><div>h1-The existence of RNA spectral, as Bio- rays ( carries genetic traits , entropy, heat, fractals , rapid exponential growth, attractive, etc.). Neuropathologically, the disease affects the caudate nucleus and the cerebral cortex, and also the hypothalamus. The recently discovered orexigenic hormone of gastric origin, ghrelin and the adipocyte hormone leptin, are two peripherally produced hormones exerting opposite effects on specific populations of hypothalamic neurons that play a key role in regulating energy intake and energy output [ Tartaglia, Louis A., et al. 2004] [8].&nbsp;Visceral sensory information is transmitted to the brain through the afferent vagus nerve.How stomach-derived ghrelin exerts these central actions is still unknown. Here we determined the role of the gastric afferent vagal nerve in ghrelin's functions.[ Date, Yukari, et al. 2002] [9] Thus, the rhythm between Hermom secretion of ghrelin, leptin plays a role in cell physiology. When a person is exposed to the greasy odors caused by cooking some chicken or the types of odors emitted from the combustion of certain plants or chewing qat tree leaves, especially with a dark red color which has a silvery thin membrane. All of the above have an impact on the rhythm of the cells that secrete hormones and cells that contain receptors.When the lack of proportion ghrelin (which should be secreted high quantities before eating) leads to increased secretion of leptin and as a person not eating the leptin plays a counter role for the hormone NPY, also it produces (leptin) from adtipose tissue of high quantities therefore less energy consumption and thus lose weight.<br></div><div>That Upon arrival odor molecules to olfactory receptors in the nose and then to the hypothalamic and the vagus nerve , where ghrelin receptors coupled GHSR1a and leads to increased secretion of ghrelin. The lay and scientific literature typically claims that humans can discriminate 10,000 odors, but this number has never been empirically validated. We determined the resolution of the human sense of smell by testing the capacity of humans to discriminate odor mixtures with varying numbers of shared components, [ Bushdid, Caroline, et al. 2014] &nbsp;[10]. The recently discovered orexigenic hormone of gastric origin, ghrelin and the adipocyte hormone leptin, are two peripherally produced hormones exerting opposite effects on specific populations of hypothalamic neurons that play a key role in regulating energy intake and energy output [Popovic, Vera, et al. 2004] &nbsp;[11] . Therefore, the chemical scents play an important role in appetite changes through their effect on the hormone receptor of Ghrelin, it is more than an insult that leptin plays a role in regulating energy consumption, and this is also observed in GERD patients. Other study curtains .Odors splash ability to play an important role in reducing the proportion of Ghrelin Thus, the lack of Ghrelin paid to satiety, and this is what happens in GERD patients&nbsp; .<br></div><div>Chemosensitivity of mouse tension and mucosal receptors is restricted to a small subpopulation, but these show robust responses consistent with expression of receptors to 5-HT, ATP, low pH, and bile constituents [12].&nbsp;Therefore GERD patients nervous conjugated with appetite disturbance , particularly when exposed to certain smells like smoke produced by the burning of Teucrium polium.&nbsp;<b><u>The role of hearing receptors in the aggravation of GERD and activity of H.pylori</u></b> In terms of hearing receptors relationship with GERD we see that there are effects accompany where they are receiving very low- frequencies do not hear it but it translates as Reflex Action such as anger, stomach pain and anxiety. Hearing plays an essential role in the physiology of cells , also auditory gens capabilities evolve in sensing low-frequency below 16 Hz , which comes from thermal objects , where we cannot hear and understand those low-frequencies, but translate ( Electrochemical reading), into nerve cells such as the heart.&nbsp;The role of H. pylori in these patients is controversial. Several trials assessed the potential role of H. pylori eradication in improving dyspeptic symptoms, and data of some meta-analyses demonstrated that cure of infection is associated with a small (10%), but significant therapeutic gain as compared to placebo [Zullo, Angelo, et al. 2014] [13]. Therefore GERD patients showed synchronized rhythm electrochemical energy and the worsening of the disease , and this demonstrates the role that Hearing receptors play in creating a fertile environment for the bacteria and thus the occurrence of indigestion For this to be the outcome of the medicine does not do any good.<br></div><div><br></div>
